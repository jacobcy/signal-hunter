# 2026-01-31 Session Log

## Database Stability Crisis
- **Issue**: "Cannot operate on a closed database" persistent error
- **Root cause**: Multiple zombie bot processes (8 instances) + incorrect aiosqlite usage
- **Solution**: Kill all processes, fix Database class to use proper `async with aiosqlite.connect()` pattern
- **Status**: Fixed and verified working

## Git Workflow Established
- Created SKILL.md with autonomous execution protocol (UNDERSTAND→PLAN→EXECUTE→VERIFY→REPORT)
- Added Git workflow standards (Conventional Commits, PR-based workflow)
- Committed all changes with proper messages

## Daily Health Check System
- Created `scripts/daily_check.sh` for automated audits
- Created `scripts/daily_check_telegram.py` for notifications
- Scheduled cron job for 9:00 AM daily (Asia/Shanghai)
- First run completed successfully

## Engineering Standards
- Added docs/ENGINEERING.md with code quality requirements
- Configured Ruff, MyPy, pre-commit hooks
- Created test framework (pytest) with sample tests
- Git standards: Conventional Commits enforced

## Zhihu Article Analysis
- Article about independent thinking vs information silos
- Key insight: Algorithmic recommendations create echo chambers
- Application to Signal Hunter: Need diversity in signal sources, avoid confirmation bias
- Recommendation: Add sentiment hedging (bullish/bearish balance detection)

## Current Issues
- 2,241 Ruff linting issues to fix
- 88 MyPy type errors
- 10 failing tests
- README.md missing

## Bot Status
- PID 62220 running cleanly
- Database operations verified working
